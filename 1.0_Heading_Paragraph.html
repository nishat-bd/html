    <h1 align="center">Bangladesh is a nasty country!</h1>
    <hr />

    <p align="center">Bangladesh, located in South Asia, is a vibrant and densely populated country known for its rich
        cultural
        heritage
        and
        stunning natural beauty. It shares its borders with India to the west, north, and east, while Myanmar (Burma)
        lies
        to
        the southeast.</p>
    <p align="left">The country is characterized by its lush green landscapes, the intricate network of rivers, and the
        world's largest river delta, the Sundarbans, home to the elusive Bengal tiger. Dhaka, the capital, is a bustling
        metropolis, and the country's people are known for their warmth and resilience. Bangladesh has a diverse
        cultural
        tapestry, with a strong influence of Bengali traditions, a rich history of art and literature, and a passion for
        cricket.</p>
    <p align="justify">Despite facing challenges such as periodic flooding and overpopulation, Bangladesh has made
        remarkable
        progress
        in various sectors, including healthcare and education, and continues to play a vital role in the region's
        economic
        and
        social development. (justify means align in both 'right' and 'left')</p>
